# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System that recommends movies to users based on similarity of overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew. The system uses TF-IDF, Count Vectorization, Cosine Similarity, and NLP techniques to compute how similar two movies are.
